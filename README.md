SketchDroid
===========

A simple drawing program for the Android OS. 

This program is a simple drawing program that allows the user to draw a variety of shapes such as circles, 
rectangles, polygons, lines, etc. It contains the ability to select and move, group, cut, copy and paste shapes. A 
color picker was used from this link:

This was a small project that I worked on over the weekend for a school assignment.
